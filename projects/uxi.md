**UXinsight (UXI)** is a system that tracks & analyzes user experiences (UX), extracting ‚Äúunseen‚Äù insights from user behavior.

UXI started as my final project for _Information Visualization_ at NYU, however quickly spiraled into a much larger idea‚Äîevaluating and improving UX using AI (ie: predicting user interface & experience issues and improving interface design by modeling user behavior).
